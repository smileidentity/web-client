# SmileID Web MonoRepo

## Overview

### Components
[Components](packages/components) is package containing web components used in
the web client.

### Embed
[Embed f.k.a. Hosted Web Integration](packages/embed) is a package that contains two items:

1. A configuration script which creates an iframe that serves some of the
    SmileID product recipes.
2. A collection of web pages and scripts: one for each product recipe

This provides the necessary structure for self-hosted integration on the web.
Detailed information about this can be found in the [packages/embed documentation](./packages/embed/README.md).

### Smart-Camera-Web
[Smart Camera Web](packages/smart-camera-web) is a package that
contains a web-component used to capture images in the browser for use within
SmileID systems.

It is WebRTC Powered Web Component that works together with the
SmileID [Server to Server](https://docs.smileidentity.com/server-to-server) libraries.

For more detailed information, you can refer to the [packages/smart-camera-web documentation](./packages/smart-camera-web/README.md).

## Quick Start

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Node.js with NVM**: Ensure you're using the correct Node.js version.
   If you don't have [NVM (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) installed:

   Activate the right Node version for this project:

   ```sh
   nvm use
   ```

2. **Installing Dependencies**:

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

### Running Tests

Both projects in this mono-repo come equipped with test suites to ensure code
quality and functionality. Here's how to run them:

1. **Smart-Camera-Web**:

   ```sh
   cd packages/smart-camera-web
   npm test
   ```

2. **Embed**:

   ```sh
   cd packages/embed
   npm test
   ```

### Storybook

Storybook is a frontend workshop for building UI components and pages in
isolation. We have adopted this for our web-components package.

#### Why Storybook?

- Isolated Environment: Develop and test UI components in isolation, which simplifies the process and enhances focus.
- Live Documentation: Automatically generate and update documentation as components evolve, providing a reliable and up-to-date reference.
- Consistency and Quality: Visually test components to maintain consistency and quality across the user interface.

#### How to use storybook?

Storybook is installed at the root of the repository, and it is configured using
the `.storybook` folder. The `main.js` file there sets up the search path for
stories.

To run storybook:

```sh
npm run storybook
```

To add stories in the components folder, add a file ending with `*.stories.js`
nested next to the component
```sh
- components
  - <component-a>
    - src
      - ComponentA.stories.js
```
