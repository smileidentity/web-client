- Install [nvm (Node Version Manager)](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) for managing Node.js versions.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/smileidentity/hosted-web-integration.git
    cd hosted-web-integration
    ```

2. Switch to the appropriate Node version using `nvm`:

    ```bash
    nvm install
    nvm use
    ```

3. Install project dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Running the Project

    ```

2. Start the local server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

3. Access the application on `http://localhost:8000`.

### Configuration

- `.git-blame-ignore-revs`: File used to ignore certain commits in `git blame`.

## Creating a Release

When you're ready to create a new release for this project, follow the steps below:

1. Bump the version in the `package.json` file:

   You can do this manually or use npm commands to update the version. For example, to bump a patch:

   ```bash
   npm version patch
   ```

   This will increase the patch version (e.g., from v1.0.0 to v1.0.1). Similarly, you can use `npm version minor` or `npm version major` for minor and major version bumps respectively.

2. Commit the change:

   If you used the npm version command, it will automatically commit the change for you with a commit message like "1.0.1". If you updated the `package.json` file manually, ensure you commit the change:

   ```bash
   git add package.json
   git commit -m "Bump version to [NEW_VERSION]"
   ```

3. Push a new tag:

   Tag the new commit with the version number and push the tag to the repository:

   ```bash
   git tag v[NEW_VERSION]
   git push origin v[NEW_VERSION]
   ```
